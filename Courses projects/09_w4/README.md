The raw USA Storm Database has not been uploaded here. It can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2).

The inspiration for this app is the Reproducible Research project (course 05 of the Coursera Specialization). 
Details can be found in the report I published on rPubs [here](http://rpubs.com/paulwasit/weatherEventsUS).

The app is running on shinyapps.io [here](https://splat.shinyapps.io/stormReport/).
