## Looping on the Command Line

- `lapply`: Loop over a list and evaluate a function on each element 

- `sapply`: Same as `lapply` but try to simplify the result

An auxiliary function `split` is also useful, particularly in conjunction with `lapply`.

- `tapply`: Apply a function over subsets of a vector

- `apply`: Apply a function over the margins of an array

- `mapply`: Multivariate version of `lapply`
