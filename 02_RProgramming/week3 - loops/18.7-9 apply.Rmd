## apply

`apply` is used to a evaluate a function (often an anonymous one) over the margins of an array.

- It is most often used to apply a function to the rows or columns of a matrix

- It can be used with general arrays, e.g. taking the average of an array of matrices 

- It is not really faster than writing a loop, but it works in one line!

It takes four arguments: 
- `X` is an array
- `MARGIN` is an integer vector indicating which margins should be “retained”. 
- `FUN` is a function to be applied
- ... is for other arguments to be passed to `FUN`


```r
x <- matrix(rep(1:5, 10), 5, 10)
x
apply(x, 2, mean) # takes the mean of each col
apply(x, 1, sum)  # takes the sum of each row
```

For sums and means of matrix dimensions, we have some _much_ faster shortcuts.

- `rowSums`  = `apply(x, 1, sum)`
- `rowMeans` = `apply(x, 1, mean)`
- `colSums`  = `apply(x, 2, sum)`
- `colMeans` = `apply(x, 2, mean)`


Quantiles of the columns of a matrix.

```r
x <- matrix(rep(1:5, 10), 5, 10)
X
apply(x, 1, quantile, probs = c(0.25, 0.75))
apply(x, 2, quantile, probs = c(0.25, 0.75))
```


Average matrix in an array

```r
a <- array(1:2, c(2, 2, 10))
a

# same as
apply(a, c(1, 2), mean)
rowMeans(a, dims = 2)

colMeans(a, dims = 2)
```
