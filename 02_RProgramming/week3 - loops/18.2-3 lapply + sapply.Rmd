## lapply: Loop over a list and evaluate a function on each element 

`lapply` takes three arguments: 
(1) a list `X`; 
(2) a function (or the name of a function) `FUN`; 
(3) other arguments via its ... argument. If `X` is not a list, it will be coerced to a list using `as.list`.

`lapply` always returns a list, regardless of the class of the input. The actual looping is done internally in C code.


```r
x <- list(a = 1:5, b = rnorm(10))
lapply(x, mean)

x <- list(a = 1:4, b = rnorm(10), c = rnorm(20, 1), d = rnorm(100, 5))
lapply(x, mean)$a
sapply(x, mean)['a']

x <- 1:4
lapply(x, runif)

# min & max, passed as ... arguments, are applied to the FUN runif
x <- 1:4
lapply(x, runif, min = 0, max = 10)  

# anonymous function for extracting the first column of each matrix
x <- list(a = matrix(1:4, 2, 2), b = matrix(1:6, 3, 2)) 
lapply(x, function(elt) elt[,1])

# same as
f <- function(elt) {
  elt[, 1]
}
lapply(x, f) 
```



## sapply: Same as `lapply` but try to simplify the result

- If the result is a list where every element is length 1, then a vector is returned

- If the result is a list where every element is a vector of the same length (> 1), a matrix is returned.

- If it canâ€™t figure things out, a list is returned


```r
x <- list(a = 1:4, b = rnorm(10), c = rnorm(20, 1), d = rnorm(100, 5))
lapply(x, mean)
sapply(x, mean) 
mean(x)
```
